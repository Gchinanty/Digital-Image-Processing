# Digital Image Processing
Several experiments I did in WHU.
## Convolution
*May 1, 2018*

 These codes are to detect edge of a camaro car in a rgb picture by convolution.
 The rgb picture experiences the following process:
 	 1 rgb -> grey -> binary -> show edge
 	 2 rgb -> grey -> convolution -> invert -> show edge
 You can find different visual effects of two methods.
